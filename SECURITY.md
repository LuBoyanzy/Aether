# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in the latest version, please open a private advisory in this repository. The dedicated Aether security channel is being set up; avoid using legacy Beszel links.

If it's low severity (use best judgement) you may open an issue instead of an advisory, clearly marking it as a security report.
